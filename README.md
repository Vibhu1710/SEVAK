SEVAK is a food delivery and sanitization robot vehicle which can be remotely controlled through a mobile application featuring live video streaming. The prototype was developed to help deliver food and medicines to covid-19 patients in corona ward thus minimizing the risk of infection for frontline doctors and medical staff.

The project was developed in a span of 4 months starting from April, 2020 and ending in late July.

Various delicate and important parts of the prototype were 3D printed with assistance from Siemens Lab, PEC.
