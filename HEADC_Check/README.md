HEADC_Check Output
---
This program is used to calibrate the Hall Effect Sensor, which measures the direction of rotation and position of the magnets fixed in the rotating part of the 
Mobile Holding Assembly. The program recieves data from the terminal and converts it into three descret values.

A modified version of this program has been used in the main program. The descret values used there are 0,1 and 2.

This file is demonstrating the output of the program.
