HEADC_Check Output
---
This program is used to calibrate the Hall Effect Sensor, which measures the direction of rotation and position of the magnets fixed in the rotating part of the 
Mobile Holding Assembly. The program recieves data from the terminal and converts it into three discrete values ( shown in red in the image below ). 

A modified version of this program has been used in the main program. The discrete values used there are 0,1 and 2.

The image below shows the output at the Serial Monitor when the upper part of the Mobile Holding Assembly is continuously rotated in Clockwise direction.
